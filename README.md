This console application simulates the movement of elevators in a building. It provides features to interact with elevators and displays their status.

## Features

- **Call Elevator**: You can call an elevator to a specific floor.
- **Set People Waiting**: You can set the number of people waiting on each floor.
- **Display Elevator Status**: It shows the status of each elevator, including its current floor, direction, current capacity, and weight limit.

## How to Use

1. **Compile and Run**: Compile and run the `Program.cs` file.
2. **Interact with Elevators**: Use the `SetPeopleWaiting` method to set the number of people waiting on each floor. Use the `CallElevator` method to call an elevator to a specific floor.
